 * truncated to 32 bits and therefore will not be valid.
 *
 * On 64-bit platforms this can be a 64-bit address which will allow the
 * full memory address in commands and telemetry, but this will break
 * compatibility with existing control systems, and may also change
 * the alignment/padding of messages.
 *
 * In either case this must be an unsigned type.
 *
 * FSW code should access this value via the macros provided, which
 * converts to the native "cpuaddr" type provided by OSAL.  This macro
 * provides independence between the message representation and local
 * representation of a memory address.
